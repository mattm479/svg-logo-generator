Then they will be asked what color they would like the text to be displayed in. Next, they w ill be asked what shape they want the logo to be - their choices are: Circle, Square and Triangle. Finally, they will be asked what color they want the shape to be. Both colors can be a CSS color keyword or hex value.Once all selections are validated, the svg logo will be generated and saved to the dist folder with the name logo.svg.
